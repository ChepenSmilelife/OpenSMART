## OpenSMART ver. 1.0 Release

We have released the backend of OpenSMART, which is the core implementation in Bluespec and Chisel. We are developing the front-end which can automate the network generation. The front-end features will include DOT topology file and configuration file support, and unified executable for compilation and simulation. Please check the website for latest news about that.

## Documentation

We are preparing more detailed documentation that describes module interfaces and behaviors of each module. We will also announce it to this page when it is available.
