OpenSMART 1.0 Bluespec System Verilog Version

If you have installed Bluespec System Verilog compiler, you can run compiliation script, "OpenSMART", in this directory.
You can either compile a simulation that evaluates the network using synthetic traffic patterns (uniform random and bit complement)
or generate Verilog code. The usage of the compilation script is as the following:

Usage
./OpenSMART (flag) (SMART)
  Available flags
  -c : compile a simulation
  -r : run the simulation
  -v : generate Verilog code
  -clean: clean up compiled files

Examples
./OpenSMART -c : compile a mesh network simulation
./OpenSMART -c SMART : compile a SMART network simulation
./OpenSMART -v : generate Verilog code of a mesh network
./OpenSMART -v SMART : generate Verilog code of a SMART network

How to config a network?
./src/Types/Types.bsv defines the dimension of network (MeshWidth, MeshHeight), number of VCs (NumUserVCs),
InjectionRate of the synthetic traffic simulation, Routing algorithm (currentRoutingAlgorithm), and so on.

To implement a network with an arbitrary topology, you need to modify Network.bsv in the 1.0 version.
However, we will provide a DOT file to topology setting converter in a later version.
